Twipstr :: Makes it more fun to update your Twitter status!

☛ http://twipstr.sf.net

====================================

Well... There's a plenty of Twitter clients out there, I know.
Lot of them make it fun to *read* your Twitter stream.
But I had no luck to find one that makes it really fun to *update* your Twitter status.
That is why I decided to create Twipstr.
It's minimalistic, but it does its job well.
And you'll love those handy pictograms!
Created for people who want to post tastefully ;)

BTW, Twipstr is cross-platform, so it will run on any modern operation system: Linux, Mac OS X, Windows... 

====================================

Installation

* If you're running Ubuntu, it's recommended to install Twipstr via PPA-repository using the following command:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ki0n/desktop-apps && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install twipstr

* If you're running other Debian-based distro, you can simply download/install DEB package and run Twipstr using "Applications -> Internet -> Twipstr" menu item or "twipstr" command

* Otherwise, put "twipstr.jar" file into the folder of your choice and double-click it or run using "java -jar twipstr.jar" command 

NOTE: You must have Java installed to run Twipstr.
If you don't have it installed yet, you can download it from here: 
http://www.java.com/download
(Installing from DEB or PPA resolves dependencies automatically though ;))

* If you're updating from previous version and want to get new pictograms/emojis, go to settings and click "Reset symbols"!
