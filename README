Twipstr :: Makes it more fun to update your Twitter status!

Put twipstr.jar file into the folder of your choice and double-click it or run using java -jar twipstr.jar command.
(creating a global shortcut/hotkey to run Twipstr is a good idea as well! ;))

NOTE: You must have Java installed to run Twipstr.
If you don't have it installed yet, you can download it from here: http://www.java.com/download
